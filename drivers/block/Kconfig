config BLK
	bool "Support block devices"
	depends on DM
	default y if DM_MMC || DM_USB
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config HAVE_BLOCK_DEVICE
	bool "Enable Legacy Block Device"
	help
	  Some devices require block support whether or not DM is enabled

config SPL_BLK
	bool "Support block devices in SPL"
	depends on SPL_DM && BLK
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config TPL_BLK
	bool "Support block devices in TPL"
	depends on TPL_DM && BLK
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache"
	depends on BLK
	default y
	help
	  This option enables a disk-block cache for all block devices.
	  This is most useful when accessing filesystems under U-Boot since
	  it will prevent repeated reads from directory structures and other
	  filesystem data structures.

config SPL_BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache in SPL"
	depends on SPL_BLK
	help
	  This option enables the disk-block cache in SPL

config TPL_BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache in TPL"
	depends on TPL_BLK
	help
	  This option enables the disk-block cache in TPL

config EFI_MEDIA
	bool "Support EFI media drivers"
	default y if EFI || SANDBOX
	help
	  Enable this to support media devices on top of UEFI. This enables
	  just the uclass so you also need a specific driver to make this do
	  anything.

	  For sandbox there is a test driver.

if EFI_MEDIA

config EFI_MEDIA_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox EFI media driver"
	depends on SANDBOX
	default y
	help
	  Enables a simple sandbox media driver, used for testing just the
	  EFI_MEDIA uclass. It does not do anything useful, since sandbox does
	  not actually support running on top of UEFI.

config EFI_MEDIA_BLK
	bool "EFI media block driver"
	depends on EFI_APP
	default y
	help
	  Enables a block driver for providing access to UEFI devices. This
	  allows use of block devices detected by the underlying UEFI
	  implementation. With this it is possible to use filesystems on these
	  devices, for example.

endif  # EFI_MEDIA

config IDE
	bool "Support IDE controllers"
	select HAVE_BLOCK_DEVICE
	help
	  Enables support for IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) hard drives.
	  This allows access to raw blocks and filesystems on an IDE drive
	  from U-Boot. See also CMD_IDE which provides an 'ide' command for
	  performing various IDE operations.
